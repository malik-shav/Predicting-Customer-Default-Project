# Predicting-Customer-Defaults---Supervised-Learning
In this project, UCI Credit Default dataset is analyzed using statistical and visualization techniques to understand the relationship between variables and their relationship to the defualt outcome. After EDA, supervised learning algorithms, including logistic regression, random forest, and KNN algorithms are implemented to train the model to predict the defaul outcome of future customers. 

The use of this model will highly benefit banks by allowing them to predict if a certain individual will default on their loan or not based on the features used above. This will lead banks to choose appropriate individuals to receive the loan and save money by reducing the number of loans given to individuals that are likely to default.
